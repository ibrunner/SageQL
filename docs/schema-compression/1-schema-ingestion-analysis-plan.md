# Phase 1: Schema Ingestion & Analysis

## Overview

This document details the implementation approach for the Schema Ingestion & Analysis phase of the GraphQL Schema Compression System. It establishes the foundation upon which the entire compression system will be built by providing reliable schema extraction and analysis capabilities.

## Step 1: Schema Introspection System

### Purpose

Create a robust system for retrieving GraphQL schema information through the standard introspection mechanism.

### Implementation Approach

1. Implement a GraphQL introspection query handler that can:
   - Connect to remote GraphQL endpoints
   - Support authentication headers for secured APIs
   - Handle error cases gracefully
   - Load schemas from local files when needed

### Input/Output Examples

**Input:**

```javascript
{
  "endpoint": "https://api.github.com/graphql",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer ghp_xyz123..."
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "__schema": {
      "queryType": { "name": "Query" },
      "mutationType": { "name": "Mutation" },
      "types": [
        {
          "kind": "OBJECT",
          "name": "User",
          "fields": [
            {
              "name": "id",
              "type": {
                "kind": "NON_NULL",
                "ofType": {
                  "kind": "SCALAR",
                  "name": "ID"
                }
              }
            },
            // Additional fields...
          ]
        },
        // Additional types...
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Validation Criteria

- Successfully connects to and retrieves schema from public GraphQL APIs
- Handles authentication correctly for private APIs
- Properly manages connection errors and timeouts
- Supports loading from both remote endpoints and local schema files
- Returns consistent format regardless of source
- Handles large schemas without memory issues

### Testing Strategy

1. Test against multiple public GraphQL APIs (GitHub, SpaceX, Yelp, etc.)
2. Test authentication handling with appropriate tokens
3. Test error cases (invalid endpoints, network failures, etc.)
4. Test loading from JSON and SDL schema files
5. Test with mock introspection responses of varying sizes

## Step 2: Schema Parser & Representation

### Purpose

Transform raw GraphQL introspection results into a standardized internal representation optimized for analysis and compression.

### Implementation Approach

1. Design an internal schema representation with:
   - Efficient type and field lookup
   - Relationship tracking capabilities
   - Support for all GraphQL type kinds
   - Memory-efficient structure
2. Implement parsing logic that converts introspection JSON to this format
3. Create utility functions for traversing and querying the schema

### Internal Schema Representation

```javascript
{
  // Main type collection with fast lookups
  "types": {
    "User": {
      "kind": "OBJECT",
      "description": "A user account",
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "id",
          "type": {
            "kind": "NON_NULL",
            "ofType": { "kind": "SCALAR", "name": "ID" }
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "name",
          "type": { "kind": "SCALAR", "name": "String" }
        }
        // More fields...
      ],
      "interfaces": ["Node"]
    },
    // More types...
  },

  // Root operation types
  "queryType": "Query",
  "mutationType": "Mutation",
  "subscriptionType": null,

  // Indexes for efficient lookups
  "typesByKind": {
    "OBJECT": ["User", "Repository", "Issue"],
    "INTERFACE": ["Node", "Actor"],
    "ENUM": ["IssueState", "PullRequestState"],
    // Other kinds...
  },

  // Field name lookup by parent type
  "fieldsByType": {
    "User": ["id", "name", "email", "bio"],
    // Other types...
  },

  // Schema statistics
  "totalTypes": 124,
  "totalFields": 934,
  "totalEnumValues": 87
}
```

### Validation Criteria

- Correctly parses all GraphQL type kinds (Object, Interface, Union, etc.)
- Preserves all schema information without loss
- Creates efficient index structures for type and field lookup
- Handles complex nested types (List of Non-Null of Interface, etc.)
- Supports schema traversal operations
- Maintains reasonable memory usage for large schemas

### Testing Strategy

1. Verify parsing of all GraphQL type kinds
2. Test with various type wrapping combinations (NON_NULL, LIST)
3. Check preservation of descriptions, deprecation info, and arguments
4. Benchmark parsing performance with large schemas
5. Verify memory efficiency
6. Test schema traversal functions

## Step 3: Relationship Analysis

### Purpose

Analyze the schema structure to identify entity types and map the relationships between them, supporting domain extraction in later phases.

### Implementation Approach

1. Develop algorithms to:
   - Identify entity types (objects with IDs or that implement Node)
   - Map relationships between entities based on field types
   - Detect foreign key patterns in field names
   - Identify common GraphQL patterns (connections, pagination)
2. Create a graph representation of schema relationships

The relationship analysis will specifically use:

- AST-based traversal of schema structure to extract entity references
- Graph-based representation of schema relationships
- Louvain community detection algorithm for identifying naturally occurring clusters
- Type and field reference pattern analysis to detect foreign key relationships
- BFS/DFS graph traversal to identify connected entity components

### Relationship Analysis Output

```javascript
{
  // Primary entity types
  "entityTypes": ["User", "Repository", "Issue", "PullRequest"],

  // Outgoing references
  "references": {
    "Repository": ["User"],         // Repository references User
    "Issue": ["User", "Repository"], // Issue references User and Repository
    "PullRequest": ["User", "Repository"]
  },

  // Incoming references
  "referencedBy": {
    "User": ["Repository", "Issue", "PullRequest"],
    "Repository": ["Issue", "PullRequest"]
  },

  // Foreign key patterns
  "foreignKeys": {
    "Issue": {
      "authorId": { "referencedType": "User" },
      "repositoryId": { "referencedType": "Repository" }
    },
    // More foreign keys...
  },

  // Connection patterns (Relay-style pagination)
  "connectionTypes": [
    {
      "connection": "RepositoryConnection",
      "edge": "RepositoryEdge",
      "node": "Repository"
    },
    // More connections...
  ],

  // Interface implementations
  "implementations": {
    "Node": ["User", "Repository", "Issue"]
  }
}
```

### Validation Criteria

- Correctly identifies entity types with unique identifiers
- Maps relationships between entities in both directions
- Detects foreign key patterns according to GraphQL naming conventions
- Identifies connection types for pagination patterns
- Works with complex, nested relationship structures
- Handles circular references appropriately

### Testing Strategy

1. Test entity identification with various ID patterns
2. Verify relationship mapping with sample schemas
3. Test foreign key detection with conventional and unconventional naming
4. Verify connection pattern detection with Relay-style schemas
5. Test with circular relationship structures
6. Benchmark performance with large, interconnected schemas

## Step 4: Schema Statistics Generation

### Purpose

Calculate metrics about the schema to guide compression decisions and identify potential optimization opportunities.

### Implementation Approach

1. Create algorithms to:
   - Calculate basic schema complexity metrics
   - Identify similar types that could be consolidated
   - Detect redundant field patterns
   - Generate schema fingerprints for change detection
2. Establish a baseline for measuring compression effectiveness

The statistics generation will utilize:

- Levenshtein distance and Jaccard similarity for detecting similar field names
- Term frequency analysis to identify common naming patterns
- Hierarchical clustering to group similar types
- Fingerprinting algorithms (e.g., SimHash) for schema change detection
- Quantitative metrics for relationship density and type connectivity

### Schema Statistics Output

```javascript
{
  // Basic metrics
  "totalTypes": 57,
  "entityTypes": 12,
  "totalFields": 342,
  "totalEnumValues": 78,
  "totalInputFields": 96,

  // Type distribution
  "typeDistribution": {
    "OBJECT": 28,
    "INTERFACE": 3,
    "UNION": 2,
    "ENUM": 8,
    "INPUT_OBJECT": 14,
    "SCALAR": 2
  },

  // Complexity metrics
  "avgFieldsPerType": 6.0,
  "maxFieldsInType": 24,
  "relationshipDensity": 0.27,  // How interconnected the entities are

  // Potential compression targets
  "similarTypeGroups": [
    {
      "name": "UserGroup",
      "baseType": "User",
      "similarTypes": ["AdminUser", "GuestUser"],
      "similarity": 0.85
    },
    {
      "name": "ItemGroup",
      "baseType": "Product",
      "similarTypes": ["Service", "Subscription"],
      "similarity": 0.73
    }
  ],

  // Redundant field patterns
  "redundantFieldPatterns": [
    {
      "pattern": "timestamp fields",
      "fields": ["createdAt", "updatedAt", "deletedAt"],
      "occurrences": 32
    },
    {
      "pattern": "name variations",
      "fields": ["name", "title", "label"],
      "occurrences": 18
    }
  ],

  // Common prefix analysis
  "commonPrefixes": [
    { "prefix": "user", "count": 14 },
    { "prefix": "repository", "count": 11 },
    { "prefix": "issue", "count": 9 }
  ],

  // Size metrics
  "schemaSize": 42680, // approximate byte size

  // Change detection
  "fingerprint": "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0"
}
```

### Validation Criteria
