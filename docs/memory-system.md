# GraphQL Schema Compression System Design

## 1. Overview

The GraphQL Schema Compression System is a core component of the GraphQL AI Agent Framework that optimizes large GraphQL schemas for efficient AI-powered query generation. By reducing schema size while preserving essential functionality, it enables more efficient operation within AI model context limits while reducing operational costs.

## 2. Goals and Requirements

### Primary Goals

- Reduce schema size by 60-80% without losing critical functionality
- Preserve the ability to generate valid queries for common use cases
- Enable dynamic access to full schema details when needed

### Requirements

- Minimize context size consumed by GraphQL schemas
- Maintain schema integrity and query validation capability
- Support progressive loading of additional schema elements
- Integrate with existing agent components (Schema Agent, Query Builder)
- Provide tools for schema exploration

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 High-Level Components

TODO

### 3.2 Component Descriptions

1. **Schema Processing Pipeline**

   - Ingests raw GraphQL schemas through introspection
   - Applies optimization and compression algorithms
   - Produces compressed schema versions
   - Tracks schema versions and change history

2. **Domain Extractor**

   - Analyzes schema structure to identify logical domains
   - Creates domain-specific schema views
   - Maps entity relationships across domains
   - Generates domain metadata for agent consumption

3. **Schema Registry**

   - Stores and indexes both compressed and full schemas
   - Provides efficient lookup for schema elements

4. **Dynamic Schema Lookup**

   - Provides just-in-time access to full schema details
   - Supports incremental schema expansion during query building
   - Offers field and type suggestion capabilities

## 4. Compression Methodology

### 4.1 Static Compression Techniques

1. **Structural Optimization**

   - Remove redundant type descriptions
   - Collapse nested type structures
   - Eliminate duplicate enumeration values
   - Normalize naming patterns

2. **Field Pruning**

   - Remove fields with default values when predictable
   - Consolidate similar fields into more compact structures
   - Eliminate deprecated and redundant fields

3. **Type Consolidation**
   - Extract common field patterns into interfaces
   - Merge similar types with slight variations
   - Create more hierarchical type structures
   - Reduce duplication through inheritance

### 4.2 Domain-Based Partitioning

1. **Entity Relationship Analysis**

   - Identify primary entity types
   - Map relationships between entities
   - Detect foreign key and reference patterns
   - Establish entity ownership hierarchy

2. **Domain Definition**

   - Group related entities into logical domains
   - Define domain boundaries and interfaces
   - Ensure cross-domain references are preserved
   - Create domain metadata for agent consumption

3. **Schema Retrieval Design**
   - Define core schema containing essential types
   - Create extension schemas for specialized operations
   - Implement loading triggers based on query complexity

### 4.3 Processing Workflow

TODO

## 6. Dynamic Schema Access

### 6.1 Progressive Schema Loading

1. **Core Schema**

   - Always available to agents
   - Contains essential types and fields
   - Optimized for common query patterns
   - Includes all primary entity types

2. **Domain Extensions**

   - Loaded based on detected intent
   - Contains domain-specific details
   - Activated when domain is primary focus

3. **Full Schema Access**
   - Available for specialized or uncommon queries
   - Accessed through lookup tool when needed

### 6.2 Schema Lookup tool

```javascript
// Example lookup API for fields not in compressed schema
async function lookupSchemaElement(elementType, name, context) {
  // Check if element is in current schema context
  if (isInCompressedSchema(elementType, name, context)) {
    return getFromCompressedSchema(elementType, name, context);
  }

  // Check cache
  const cachedElement = schemaCache.get(`${elementType}:${name}`);
  if (cachedElement) {
    return cachedElement;
  }

  // Perform lookup in full schema
  const element = await getFromFullSchema(elementType, name);

  // Cache result
  schemaCache.set(`${elementType}:${name}`, element);

  return element;
}
```

## 7. Integration with Agent Framework

### 7.1 Schema Agent Adaptation

1. **Context Optimization**

   - Load appropriate schema context based on user intent
   - Switch between domain-specific views as needed
   - Use compressed schema as default context
   - Request additional schema details when required

2. **Schema Understanding**
   - Understand relationships between domains
   - Recognize when to access full schema information
   - Track which elements are in compressed vs. full schema
   - Manage schema context efficiently

### 7.2 Query Builder Integration

1. **Progressive Query Construction**

   - Start with compressed schema fields
   - Dynamically expand when required fields are missing
   - Track field usage for schema optimization
   - Validate against full schema when complete

2. **Field Suggestion Enhancement**
   - Suggest fields based on compressed schema first
   - Offer additional field suggestions from full schema when relevant
   - Prioritize commonly-used field patterns
   - Track suggestion acceptance rates

## 9. Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Compression System

- Implement basic schema processing pipeline
- Develop structural optimization techniques
- Create initial domain extraction algorithms
- Build basic schema registry

### Phase 2: Dynamic Schema Access

- Implement progressive schema loading
- Develop schema lookup API
- Create caching and optimization layer
- Build usage tracking mechanisms

### Phase 3: Agent Integration

- Adapt Schema Agent for compressed schemas
- Enhance Query Builder with dynamic schema access
- Implement domain-aware query planning
- Create validation mechanisms for compressed schemas

## 10. Conclusion

The GraphQL Schema Compression System represents a strategic approach to handling large GraphQL schemas within the constraints of AI model contexts. By combining static optimization techniques with dynamic access patterns, the system enables efficient operation while preserving full schema capabilities when needed.
