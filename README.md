```

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Run the introspection script to fetch the GraphQL schema:
   ```bash
   yarn introspect
   ```

## Usage

### Query Generation

Generate and execute GraphQL queries from natural language:

```bash
yarn query "Show me all launches with their mission names and crew members"
```

The script will:

1. Generate a GraphQL query from your natural language request
2. Validate the query against the schema
3. Execute the query and return results

### Chat Interface

For interactive query generation:

```bash
yarn chat
```

### Preview Queries

Preview generated queries without executing them:

```bash
yarn preview "Show me all launches with their mission names and crew members"
```

## Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `GRAPHQL_API_URL`: The URL of your GraphQL API
- `MODEL_NAME`: (Optional) The OpenAI model to use (defaults to gpt-4-turbo-preview)

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. Create new agents in `/src/agents`
2. Add new tools in `/src/tools`
3. Update the LangGraph orchestration in `graph.ts`
4. Add new scripts in `/src/scripts`

### Testing

```bash
yarn typecheck  # Type checking
yarn lint      # Linting
yarn format    # Code formatting
```

### Running Tests

The project uses Jest for testing. You can run tests using the following commands:

```bash
yarn test           # Run all tests
yarn test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
yarn test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report

# Run tests for a specific file
yarn test path/to/your-test-file.test.ts

# Run tests matching a specific pattern
yarn test -t "test pattern"
```

Example of running tests for a specific component:

```bash
yarn test src/agents/query-builder/__tests__/query-builder.test.ts
```

## Architecture

The system uses a LangGraph-based architecture with specialized agents:

1. **Query Builder Agent**: Generates GraphQL queries from natural language
2. **Query Validator**: Validates queries against the schema
3. **GraphQL Executor**: Executes validated queries

The workflow is orchestrated by a LangGraph that:

- Handles state management
- Implements retry logic for failed validations
- Manages the flow between agents
- Provides error handling and recovery
