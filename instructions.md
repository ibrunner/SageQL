# Spike to understand feasibly:

## Deliverables

- reusable AI prompt w/ introspection query
- AI tool to call graphql API with queries and return results
- generate queries dynamically
- conversation samples/examples using generated queries

## Development Steps

1. establish graphql connection with source that has introspection

- Select a source that has a public graphql API with introspection. For the purposes of a POC we should pick something simple like the star wars database used for graphql documentation
- create config files for API connection config - env files, example env files, etc
- create script to retrieve introspection query including all info and types
- script should save query response to a file. this file will be read from the app, use a file format optimized for this
- add script to the scripts section in the package.json file so that it can be called from CLI

2. create a chat script that provides introspection query to context

- boilerplate for openAI api interaction
- use AI package from vercel
- create env files and example env files for storage of API keys, API url, model name
- create a simple system prompt that explains its purpose to talk to graphql apis using an introspection query
- create a few sample scripts that can ask generic questions about the api - what is it's purpose, what are it's main entities, generate a query that might be useful, etc
  - save these as files
- create a script that runs the basic scripts in the CLI
  - it should combine the system prompt with the introspection query that was generated in step 1
  - it should select a random sample prompt to run
  - it should show the user which prompt it's running
  - it should show the chat reponse to the prompt
  - add a verbose mode that logs the system prompt, sample prompt, and any other extra logging that would be useful for debugging

3. query generation tool

- create a tool that the AI script can call to generate graphQL queries
- create a special system prompt telling the AI that it is a tool to generate graphql queries
- integrate the tool calling into our primary chat bot. evaluate sample scripts to include uses that would require tool calling
- add logging
- add a step to validate the query before it is returned, include retry logic if validation fails
